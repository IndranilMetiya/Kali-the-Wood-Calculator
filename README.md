This is Unique App that resolves a common problem for the wood seller, the main exciting thing about this app is the app resolves that problem which is not solved till yet by any app in playstore yet.
So what the App does -
Lets take a scenario - I am willing to sell a tree and you are a wood seller You have come to me to buy the tree now you have to give me a valuation of the tree, so how will you valute there is some certain parametrs -
  1. Catagory of the tree ( saal / segun )
  2. From the tree how much actual beam will come as in the Store a customer buys beam (square in shape) not a tree (usually after cutting round in shape)
So here I am solving point no 2 that from a tree how much cubic ft beam will produce so that the tree buyer can easily calculate, and also there is some additional feature to calculate the total bill.

So there may be a question - how the tree buyers / woood sellers buy trees before ? 
:-P so the answer is they used to use a book , full of tables to calculate the measurement its called 'KALI BOOK' so this app digitized the book and there are many friends from where I had heard the problem as they are wood selllers now they are using my app.
